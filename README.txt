The .html files in this directory are examples of how the jnrwebsocket library from INTEG can be used to interact with the JNIOR itself. These examples show different ways you can configure the registries, files, and permissions on the JNIOR. The files in the Integ folder of this directory simply contain the libraries that need to be referenced within .html files and included in the .html files directory so they can be utilized. To test out the .html files on a JNIOR, each one needs to be edited to include that JNIOR’s IP. In each .html file is a line of code like this:

 jnrwebsocket.connect();

Inside the parenthesis of this line of code, you’ll need to enter ‘ws://IP Address’. Replace the IP Address with the IP address of the JNIOR, and include the apostraphes around it. Once that is done in each .html file, those examples when opened should execute its functionality on that JNIOR. In these examples most of the changes they make aren’t displayed directly on the page, and are simply logged to the web browser console that opens the .html example. To view what the example logs to the web browser console, just hit F12 on the web page. Looking at the code of each .html file, each function in the .html examples has comments that explain the function name, its parameter(s), its returned value(s), and what the example using that function does.
